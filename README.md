# Inventory System

The Inventory System is a lightweight C# console application designed to manage product inventories through a user-friendly command-line interface. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete product records and persist them using JSON file-based storage. The project is modular, following clean architecture principles with separation of concerns across models, services, interfaces, and validation layers. This makes the system easy to maintain, extend, and test.
